There are several use cases for job data from analyzing job opportunities to job market as a whole. So, obviously it's big in recruitment, though not only that.
It can be quite important in market predictions as in it helps you understand the health and demand of some markets for investing.
For example, if everyone's posting jobs for "mining" maybe it's a good time to invest some money into shovel production.
It can also be used for competitor tracking. 
If you see your competitor post jobs for "Game designer" they're probably making a game. Also, you get a view into what technologies their using as it's often listed as well.
The "big data" keyword is not as big as it used to be but it still very much runs most of the world.
